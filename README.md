# Clean-route
Recommend environmentally friendly and sustainable tourism routes to travel in city of Medellin.
The "Clean Routes" project aims to recommend environmentally friendly and sustainable tourism routes to travel in city of Medellin. Offering some tourist routes and itineraries, based on the different criteria such as the security, the mobility and themes.

## How to reduce the growing environmental impact of tourism in Medellin?

Part of the problem is the increase in the mobility of cars and motorcycles, which through the combustion of oil, diesel and natural gas generate 80 percent of minor particles, in addition to 74 percent of emissions of carbon dioxide, 99 percent of methane emissions and 80 percent of nitrous oxygen emissions.

Precisely, to reduce the effects of pollution, the entities in charge have recommended the use of mass transportation (metro, cable, metroplus and tram) and the bicycle, as alternatives to visit the city of Medellin and learn about everything that has to offer.

With this project we would be collaborating with one of the Sustainable Development Goals (ODGs), specifically number 11 "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." Focusing on Target 11.6 "By 2030, reduce the per capita adverse environmental impact of cities, including with particular attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management", by defining public transportation, cycling and walking as the main methods of mobility in Medellin we would be directly facing the existing problem with air quality.
